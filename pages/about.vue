      It has become common practice to use factor analysis to derive personality
      traits. The Big Five model proposes that there are five basic personality
      traits. These traits were derived in accordance with the lexical
      hypothesis. These five personality traits: Extraversion, Neuroticism,
      Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience have garnered
      widespread support

      The Big Five Aspect Scale contains 100 items and is designed to measure
      the Big Five personality characteristics both at the trait and aspect
      level. The aspect level is described as being "a level of trait
      organization located between facets and domains"

      A note on terminology: <em>personality traits</em> describe, relative to
      other people, the frequency or intensity of a person's feelings, thoughts,
      or behaviors.Possession of a trait is therefore a matter of degree. We
      might describe two individuals as extraverts, but still see one as more
      extroverted than the other. This report uses expressions such as
      'extrovert' or 'high in extraversion' to describe someone who is likely to
      be seen by others as relatively extroverted.

      The computer program that generates this report classifies you as low,
      average, or high in a trait according to whether your score is
      approximately in the lowest 30%, middle 40%, or highest 30% of scores
      obtained by people of your sex and roughly your age. Your numerical scores
      are reported and graphed as percentile estimates. For example, a score of
      '60' means that your level on that trait is estimated to be higher than
      60% of persons of your sex and age. Please keep in mind that 'low,'
      'average,' and 'high' scores on a personality test are neither absolutely
      good nor bad. A particular level on any trait will probably be neutral or
      irrelevant for a great many activities, be helpful for accomplishing some
      things, and detrimental for accomplishing other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with any personality inventory, scores and descriptions can only
      approximate an individual's actual personality. High and low score
      descriptions are usually accurate, but average scores close to the low or
      high boundaries might misclassify you as only average. On each set of six
      subdomain scales it is somewhat uncommon but certainly possible to score
      high in some of the subdomains and low in the others. In such cases more
      attention should be paid to the subdomain scores than to the broad domain
      score.
